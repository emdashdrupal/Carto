### The difference between Building\<VehicleType\>, Depot\<VehicleType\> & Stop\<VehicleType\>

* The POI with the category “*Building\<VehicleType\>*” represents a building with the *\<VehicleType\>* transportation services. For example, an International Airport building has the value of `BuildingPassengerTrain, BuildingBus, BuildingCargoAirplane, BuildingPassengerAirplane, BuildingTaxi`.
* The POI with the category “*Depot\<VehicleType\>*” represents a maintenance / storage building for the *\<VehicleType\>*. For example, a Subway Yard building has the value of `DepotSubway`.
* The POI with the category “*Stop\<VehicleType\>*” represents a stop on the *\<VehicleType\>*’s transportation route. A transportation building can have multiple stops: For example, a Bus Station building without any upgrade has six platforms, which means that there will be six individual points with the value of `StopBus` marking each plaftorm of the bus terminal; a Train Station without any upgrade has three available platforms, so three individual points with the value of `StopPassengerTrain` will be exported.
