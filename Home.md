### Feedback and Contacts

You can reach me at the PDX forum’s comment section, Cities: Skylines Modding Discord server, or Cities: Skylines Taiwan Assets Discord server. If you need to start a more in-depth discussion or report complicated bugs, I’d suggest using GitHub’s issues or discussions, as it isn’t easy to track them between threads.
